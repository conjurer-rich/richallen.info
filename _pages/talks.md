## Featured Talks

### Finding teams and service boundaries with User Needs Mapping

**Event**: [Fast Flow Conference 2023](https://fastflowconf.com/)  
**Date**: [May, 2023]  
**Summary**: Finding team and service boundaries with User Needs Mapping\n\nAs teams grow, "awkward" interactions can signal the need for evolution, but knowing change is needed and deciding how to implement it are different challenges. This talk follows a real-world case of a company reorganizing its teams and explores how User Needs Mapping, combined with Team Topologies heuristics, helps identify and validate team and service boundaries. By simplifying the adoption of techniques like Wardley Mapping and Domain-Driven Design, this approach reduces cognitive overload and supports effective organizational design.

### Planning for growth with Team Topologies

**Event**: [Lean Agile Brighton 2022](https://leanagilebrighton.co.uk/)  
**Date**: [November, 2022]  
**Summary**: Team Topologies is often seen as a tool for 'big' organizations, but this talk debunks that myth by showcasing its applicability to organizations of any size. Using the real-world example of Passenger, a Bournemouth-based sustainable transport startup, we explore how they leveraged Team Topologies principles to address the challenge of doubling their headcount while designing an effective team structure.
