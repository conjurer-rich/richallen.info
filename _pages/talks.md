## Featured Talks

### From Inside-Out to Outside-In: Aligning teams around what matters

**Event**: [Fast Flow Conference NL 2025](https://fastflowconf.com/)  
**Date**: [March, 2025]  
**Summary**: Most organizations optimize internal processes, unintentionally creating silos that hinder value delivery.
This talk introduces User Needs Mapping as a practical approach to shift thinking to an outside-in perspective — aligning teams around real user needs, fostering ownership, and reducing organizational complexity.

Through actionable examples and real-world stories, audiences learn how to uncover what truly matters to users and build structures that deliver value more effectively.
